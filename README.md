<h3>My Goals and Aspirations</h3>
<div>
  <p>Cybersecurity to me is an exciting topic of discussion. Why you may ask? Because in my eyes, Cybersecurity
    is a rapidly growing field, driven by the dependence on digital technologies to protect systems, data, and 
    networks from a wide range of cyber threats.</p>
  <br> 
  <p>Careers in cybersecurity typically start as security analysts with advancing roles later on like security 
    engineer, ethical hacker, or even security architect. However, my goal is to become a chief information 
    security officer (CISO). Currently, I want to specialize in key areas such as network security, application 
    security, penetration testing, and threat analysis on my journey to acquiring the needed skills for my future 
    role.</p>
